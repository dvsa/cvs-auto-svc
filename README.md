#### Security

Please install and run the following securiy programs as part of your testing process:

https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets

- After installing, do a one-time set up with `git secrets --register-aws`. Run with `git secrets --scan`.

https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner

These will be run as part of prepush so please make sure you set up the git hook above so you don't accidentally introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
